Android-and-PHP-Library
=======================

The PHP website lets the user make changes to a MySQL database, and it also provides scripts that return JSON representation of the database. The Android application retrieves the database using these scripts and allows some manipulation,searching. The application also keeps a local copy and saves local changes (modification, removal, addition) to a local SQLite database.
